      // the first thing we are doing here is grabbing the button element, because we need an element to operate on.
      // next we access a method on that element call 'addEventListeners' which takes two paramenters and then do somethings inside the second parameter which is a callback

      //now here we see the callback in action well, what we are saying is this, we are waiting for a click to happen on this button, this specific button, when it happens run this function called what?????? Emeka I am looking at you for this one.
      const button = document.querySelector('.event-button');
      button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Hello sweet guys');
